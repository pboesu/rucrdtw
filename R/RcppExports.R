#' UCR DTW Algorithm file-file method
#'
#' Sliding-window similarity search using DTW distance. This implementation is very close to the UCR Suite command line utility, in that it takes files as inputs for both query and data
#'
#' @name ucrdtw_ff
#' @param data character; path to data file
#' @param query character; path to query file
#' @param qlength integer; length of the query (number of data points), usually this should be equivalent to length(query), but it can be shorter.
#' @param dtwwindow double; Size of the warping window size (as a proportion of query length). The DTW calculation in `rucrdtw` uses a symmetric Sakoe-Chiba band. See Giorgino (2009) for a general coverage of warping window constraints.
#' @return a ucrdtw object. A list with the following elements
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \strong{location:} The starting location of the nearest neighbor of the given query, of size \code{length(query)}, in the data. Note that location starts from 1.
#'   \item \strong{distance:} The DTW distance between the nearest neighbor and the query.
#'   \item \strong{prunedKim:} Percentage of subsequences that were pruned based on the LB-Kim criterion.
#'   \item \strong{prunedKeogh:} Percentage of subsequences that were pruned based on the LB-Keogh-EQ criterion.
#'   \item \strong{prunedKeogh2:} Percentage of subsequences that were pruned based on the LB-Keogh-EC criterion.
#'   \item \strong{dtwCalc:} Percentage of subsequences for which the full DTW distance was calculated.
#' }
#' For an explanation of the pruning criteria see Rakthanmanon et al. (2012).

#' UCR DTW Algorithm vector-vector method
#'
#' Sliding-window similarity search using DTW distance. This implementation of the UCR Suite command line utility, takes an R numeric vector as data input and an R numeric vector for the query
#'
#' @name ucrdtw_vv
#' @param data numeric vector containing data
#' @param query numeric vector containing the query. The length of this vector determines the query length.
#' @param dtwwindow double; Size of the warping window size (as a proportion of query length). The DTW calculation in `rucrdtw` uses a symmetric Sakoe-Chiba band. See Giorgino (2009) for a general coverage of warping window constraints.
#' @param epoch int defaults to 1e5, should be \eqn{\le} 1e6. This is the size of the data chunk that is processed at once. All cumulative values in the algorithm will be restarted after \code{epoch} iterations to reduce floating point errors in these values.
#' @param skip bool defaults to FALSE. If TRUE bound calculations and if necessary, distance calculations, are only performed on non-overlapping segments of the data (i.e. multiples of \code{qlength}). This is useful if \code{data} is a set of multiple reference time series, each of length \code{qlength}. The location returned when skipping is the index of the subsequence.
