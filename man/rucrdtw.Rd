\title{rucrdtw: Fast time series subsequence search in R}
\description{
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) methods provide algorithms to optimally map a given time series onto all or part of another time series. The remaining cumulative distance between the series after the alignment is a useful distance metric in time series data mining applications for tasks such as classification, clustering, and anomaly detection. A broad suite of DTW algorithms is implemented in R in the \strong{dtw} package (Giorgino 2009).

Calculating a DTW alignment is computationally relatively expensive, and as a consequence DTW is often a bottleneck in time series data mining applications. The UCR Suite (Rakthanmanon et al. 2012) provides a highly optimized algorithm for best-match subsequence searches that avoids unnecessary distance computations and thereby enables fast DTW and Euclidean Distance queries even in data sets containing trillions of observations.

The \strong{rucrdtw} package provides R bindings for the UCR Suite. In addition to queries and data stored in text files, rucrdtw also implements methods for queries and/or data that are held in memory as R objects, as well as a method to do fast similarity searches against reference libraries of time series. The following table gives a quick overview over the different methods provided by \code{rucrdtw}:
