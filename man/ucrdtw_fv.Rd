\title{UCR DTW Algorithm file-vector method}
\usage{
ucrdtw_fv(data, query, dtwwindow)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{character; path to data file}

\item{query}{numeric vector containing the query. The query length is set to the length of this object.}

\item{dtwwindow}{double; Size of the warping window size (as a proportion of query length). The DTW calculation in `rucrdtw` uses a symmetric Sakoe-Chiba band. See Giorgino (2009) for a general coverage of warping window constraints.}
}
\value{
a ucrdtw object. A list with the following elements
\itemize{
  \item \strong{location:} The starting location of the nearest neighbor of the given query, of size \code{length(query)}, in the data. Note that location starts from 1.
  \item \strong{distance:} The DTW distance between the nearest neighbor and the query.
  \item \strong{prunedKim:} Percentage of subsequences that were pruned based on the LB-Kim criterion.
  \item \strong{prunedKeogh:} Percentage of subsequences that were pruned based on the LB-Keogh-EQ criterion.
  \item \strong{prunedKeogh2:} Percentage of subsequences that were pruned based on the LB-Keogh-EC criterion.
  \item \strong{dtwCalc:} Percentage of subsequences for which the full DTW distance was calculated.
}
For an explanation of the pruning criteria see Rakthanmanon et al. (2012).

\description{
Sliding-window similarity search using DTW distance. This implementation of the UCR Suite command line utility, takes a data file as input and an R numeric vector for the query
}
\examples{
#locate example data file
dataf <- system.file("extdata/col_sc.txt", package="rucrdtw")
#load example data set
data("synthetic_control")
#extract first row as query
query <- synthetic_control[1,]
#run query
ucrdtw_fv(dataf, query, 0.05)
}
