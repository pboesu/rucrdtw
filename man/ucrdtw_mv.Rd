\title{UCR DTW Algorithm matrix-vector method}
\usage{
ucrdtw_mv(data, query, dtwwindow, epoch = 1e+05, skip = TRUE, byrow = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{numeric matrix containing data}

\item{query}{numeric vector containing the query. This determines the query length.}

\item{dtwwindow}{double; Size of the warping window size (as a proportion of query length). The DTW calculation in `rucrdtw` uses a symmetric Sakoe-Chiba band. See Giorgino (2009) for a general coverage of warping window constraints.}

\item{epoch}{int defaults to 1e5, should be \eqn{\le} 1e6. This is the size of the data chunk that is processed at once. All cumulative values in the algorithm will be restarted after \code{epoch} iterations to reduce floating point errors in these values.}

\item{skip}{boolean; defaults to TRUE. If TRUE bound calculations and if necessary, distance calculations, are only performed on non-overlapping segments of the data (i.e. multiples of \code{length(query)}). This is useful if \code{data} is a set of multiple reference time series, each of length \code{length(query)}. The location returned when skipping is the index of the subsequence.}

\item{byrow}{logical; If TRUE rows in \code{data} represent time-series, columns time-points}
}
\value{
a ucrdtw object. A list containing the following elements
\itemize{
  \item \strong{location:} The row or column number of the nearest neighbor of the given query in the data set.
  \item \strong{distance:} The DTW distance between the nearest neighbor and the query.
  \item \strong{prunedKim:} Percentage of subsequences that were pruned based on the LB-Kim criterion.
  \item \strong{prunedKeogh:} Percentage of subsequences that were pruned based on the LB-Keogh-EQ criterion.
  \item \strong{prunedKeogh2:} Percentage of subsequences that were pruned based on the LB-Keogh-EC criterion.
  \item \strong{dtwCalc:} Percentage of subsequences for which the full DTW distance was calculated.
}
}
\description{
This implementation of the UCR Suite command line utility, takes an R numeric matrix as data input and an R numeric vector for the query.
The default behaviour differs from the other methods, in that it does not perform a sliding window search for a match.
Instead it is designed to find a best match for a query in a reference set of time-series of the same length as the query.
This is useful, for example, when comparing a time-series of undetermined class to a labelled reference set of classified time-series.
